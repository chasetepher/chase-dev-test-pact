# chase-dev-test-pact

Hey there, thanks for checking out my project. This was a fun and quick demo to show off some front end skills in a real world type environment. In its 
current iteration, it is mobile friendly but if you are testing it in the dev tools you do have to refresh the page for it to be made aware of its screen size. 
A more traditional mobile site would be a good goal for v2. Additional custom cards were created to be put into the carousel, so that there was content 
that you could slide to show the slider functionality. Only the first four cards show in the mobile version, that is by design, this keeps the length from 
getting unwieldy.
